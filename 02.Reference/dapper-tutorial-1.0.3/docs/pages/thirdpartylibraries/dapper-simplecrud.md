## Dapper.SimpleCRUD

### Overview

Dapper.SimpleCRUD is a small library package which adds basic CRUD operations to Dapper. Dapper.SimpleCRUD uses smart defaults without using attributes is your classes, but it can also be overridden as needed.

- The id column is used as a primary key by default, but you can override it with an attribute.
- By default, queries expect that table name is matching the class name, but you can override it with an attribute.
- Similarly, queries expect that column name is matching the property name, but you can also override it with an attribute.

var invoiceId = connection.Insert(new Invoice { Kind = InvoiceKind.WebInvoice, Code = "Insert_Single_1" });

invoice.Code = "Update_Invoice";
invoice.Kind = InvoiceKind.StoreInvoice;
