## Dapper.Rainbow

### Overview

Dapper.Rainbow is a small library which contains an abstract class that you can add to your project and use as a base class for your Dapper classes to provide CRUD operations, such as inserting, deleting, updating and getting records.

- Get
- Insert
- Update
- Delete
- All

Dapper.Rainbow is a wrapper for database interactions and will create SQL based on property names and type constraints.

### Installation

Dapper.Rainbow is available through NuGet: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper.Rainbow/" target="_blank">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper.Rainbow/</a>

You can easily install this library by running the following command:

> PM> Install-Package Dapper.Rainbow

More information and documentation can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper/tree/master/Dapper.Contrib">https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper/tree/master/Dapper.Contrib</a>

### APIs

Once you installed this library, you will need to create a new class and derived from the Database<T> class which will work as a container for all the tables.

{% highlight csharp %}

class MyDatabase : Database<MyDatabase>
{
    public Table<Invoice> Invoices { get; set; }
}

{% endhighlight %}

You can now use CRUD methods easily in your code.

{% highlight csharp %}

using (var connection = My.ConnectionFactory())
{
    connection.Open();

    var db = MyDatabase.Init(connection, commandTimeout: 2);

    int? invoiceId = db.Invoices.Insert(new { Kind = InvoiceKind.WebInvoice, Code = "Insert_Single_1" });

    var invoice = db.Invoices.Get((int)invoiceId);

    db.Invoices.Update(invoice.Id, new { Kind = InvoiceKind.StoreInvoice, Code = "Update_Single_1" });

    invoice = db.Invoices.Get(invoice.Id);

    var status = db.Invoices.Delete(invoice.Id);

    var invoices = db.Invoices.All();
}

{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, there is no proper documentation available for this library.

### Limitations

- There is no support for composite key mapping.
- Identity column name for all tables must be called **Id**.

### Support

This library is supported on a regular basis and you will get your answers within next few days. <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper/issues">https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper/issues</a>
