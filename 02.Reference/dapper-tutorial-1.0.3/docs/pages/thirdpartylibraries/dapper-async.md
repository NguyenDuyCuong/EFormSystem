## Dapper-Async

### Overview

Dapper-Async is a small library package which extends the IDbConnection interface with Async (asynchronous) methods. With asynchronous programming, you can enhance the overall responsiveness of your application and also avoid performance bottlenecks. 

To allow asynchronous database queries, dapper has also added a set of QueryAsync methods using .NET Framework 4.5's Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern.

### Installation

Dapper-Async is only available through NuGet: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper-Async/" target="_blank">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper-Async/</a>

You can easily install this library by running the following command:

> PM> Install-Package Dapper-Async 

More information can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper" target="_blank">https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper</a>

### APIs

Once you installed this library then it will extend your IDbConnection interface with the following methods:

- ExecuteAsync
- QueryAsync
- QueryFirstAsync
- QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync
- QuerySingleAsync
- QuerySingleOrDefaultAsync
- QueryMultipleAsync

You can use these extension methods easily in your code.

{% highlight csharp %}

var affectedRows = connection.ExecuteAsync(sql,
        new {Kind = InvoiceKind.WebInvoice, Code = "Single_Insert_1"},
        commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure)
    .Result;
    
var invoices = connection.QueryAsync<Invoice>(sql).Result.ToList();

var invoice = connection.QueryFirstAsync<Invoice>(sql, new {InvoiceID = 1}).Result;

var invoice = connection.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync<Invoice>(sql, new {InvoiceID = 1}).Result;

var invoice = connection.QuerySingleAsync<Invoice>(sql, new {InvoiceID = 1}).Result;

var invoice = connection.QuerySingleOrDefaultAsync<Invoice>(sql, new {InvoiceID = 1}).Result;

using (var multi = connection.QueryMultipleAsync(sql, new { InvoiceID = 1 }).Result)
{
    var invoice = multi.Read<Invoice>().First();
    var invoiceItems = multi.Read<InvoiceItem>().ToList();
}
