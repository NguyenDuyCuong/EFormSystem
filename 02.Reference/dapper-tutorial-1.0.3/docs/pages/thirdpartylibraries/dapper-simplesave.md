## Dapper.SimpleSave

### Overview

Dapper.SimpleSave is a small library package which adds basic CRUD operations to Dapper. Dapper easily retrieve data from the database when a single object is involved, but when you are dealing with complex hierarchies, then dapper is not very helpfull.

### Attributes

Dapper.SimpleSave need to decorate your domain classes with attribute, for example; 

- Names of the tables and columns in a database.
- Which property represent primary key columns. 
- The cardinality of relationships between tables etc.

public class Invoice
{
    [PrimaryKey]
    public int? Id { get; set; }
    public string Code { get; set; }
    public InvoiceKind Kind { get; set; }

    [OneToMany]
    public List<InvoiceItem> Items { get; set; }

    public InvoiceDetail Detail { get; set; }
}

{% endhighlight %}
